# Another Vim setup

So I've been fine tuning my vim setup for a long time now. It's a mix of features I found whilst trying to evolve the perfect setup for me.

## First Up

I work on a Mac, so have no idea want will happen with this setup on other machines.

## Also

I use [https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen](Pathogen). You may want to remove it from the autoload dir and clone the latest version in there. Same goes for other plugins actually.

## Install

* Clone this lot in a .vim dir in your home dir
* symlink the .vimrc file into your home dir
